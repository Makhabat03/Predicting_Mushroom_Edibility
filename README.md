# Predicting_Mushroom_Edibility
For this project, we worked on predicting whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous using a dataset inspired by the UCI Mushroom Dataset. The dataset includes over 61,000 records with different features like cap shape, gill color, stem height, and more.

We used different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to build our classification models. After testing these models, we created an Ensemble Model with Stacking Classifier, combining all of them for better results.

We also spent time cleaning the data, fixing missing values, and preparing the data for the models. In the end, we made sure our models performed well and could predict mushroom edibility accurately.

This project helped us put all the things we learned in our Machine Learning class into practice.
